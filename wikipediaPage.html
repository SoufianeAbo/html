        active <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season target = "_blank">2005 Atlantic hurricane
        season</a>. It was not named by the <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center target = "_blank">National Hurricane Center</a>
        as it was operationally classified as an <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extratropical_cyclone target = "_blank">extratropical low</a>.
        It developed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, an unusual region for late-season <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclogenesis target = "_blank">tropical cyclogenesis</a>.
        Nonetheless, the system was able to generate a well-defined centre convecting around a warm core on 4 October. The system
        was short-lived, crossing over the <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azores target = "_blank">Azores</a> later on 4 October before becoming
        extratropical again on 5 October. No damages or fatalities were reported during that time. Its remnants were soon absorbed
        into a <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_front target = "_blank">cold front</a>. That system went on to become
        <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Vince target = "_blank">Hurricane Vince</a>, which affected the

        The subtropical nature of this unnamed system was determined several months after the fact, while the National Hurricane Center
        was performing its annual review of the season. Upon reclassification, the storm was entered into
        <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HURDAT target = "_blank">HURDAT</a>, the official hurricane database.</p>

            <p>The system originated out of an upper-level low just west of the <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands target = "_blank">Canary Islands</a>
            on 28 September. The low organized itself over the next days, producing several bursts of convection. While remaining non-tropical with a
            <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold-core_low target = "_blank">cold core</a> it moved gradually west to northwest. On 3 October,
            it became a broad surface low about 400 nautical miles (740 kilometres; 460 miles) southwest of
            <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Miguel_Island target = "_blank">SÃ£o Miguel Island</a> in the
            <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azores target = "_blank">Azores</a>. Early on 4 October, convection increased as the surface low
            organized itself, and the system became a subtropical depression.
            
            <br>
        
            Around the same time, the depression turned northeast into a <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warm_front target = "_blank">warm sector</a> ahead of an
            oncoming cold front and strengthened into a <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropical_storm target = "_blank">subtropical storm</a>.
            The system continued to track northeast and strengthened slightly, reaching its peak intensity of 85 km/h (53 mph) as it approached the Azores
            that evening. After tracking through the area, the storm weakened slightly as it moved to the north-northeast. Through an interaction with the cold front
            early on 5 October, the subtropical storm became extratropical. The system was fully absorbed by the front later that day. The newly absorbed system
            would seperate from the dissolving frontal system and become <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Vince>Subtropical Storm Vince</a>
            on 8 October.

            <br><br>

            At the time, the system was not believed to have been subtropical. However, there were several post-<a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season target = "_blank">season</a>
            findings that confirmed that the system was indeed one. The first finding was the cloud pattern, which had deep
            <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection target = "_blank">convection</a> around the centre and was better organized with a well-defined
            centre of circulation. In addition, the system had a warm core more typical of tropical cyclones as opposed to the cold core of extratropical
            cyclones. The warm-core nature also meant that there were no warm or <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_front target = "_blank">cold fronts</a>
            attached to the system, as temperatures did not change ahead of and behind the system, until an unrelated cold front passed the Azores. Satellite imagery
            suggested that the system was briefly a tropical storm as the warm core was found; however, the widespread wind field and the presence of an upper-level
            trough confirmed that it was only subtropical.</p>

            <hr class = "solid"><br>
            <p>Tropical storm-force winds were reported across parts of the Azores, primarily on the eastern islands. The strongest winds were reported on
            <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Maria_Island_(Azores) target = "_blank">Santa Maria Island</a>, where <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind#Definition target = "_blank">10-minute sustained winds</a>
            reached 79 km/h (49 mph) with gusts to 94 km/h (58 mph). <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponta_Delgada target = "_blank">Ponta Delgada</a> faced 61 km/h (38 mph) winds, with the peak recorded gust being 85 km/h (53 mph). No damage
            or fatalities were reported.

            <br><br>
            The 2005 Azores storm was not classified as a subtropical storm until April 2006, after a reassessement by the National Hurricane Center. Had it been operationally
            classified as such, it would have been named <strong><i>Tammy.</i></strong> Every year, the <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center target = "_blank">National Hurricane Center</a> (NHC)
            re-analyzes the systems of the past hurricane season and revises the storm history if there is new data that was operationally unavailable. The reanalysis revealed that the storm became a subtropical storm
            on 4 October, making it the earliest forming 19th Atlantic tropical or subtropical storm on record. The previous record holder was an
            <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1933_Atlantic_hurricane_season#Tropical_Storm_Nineteen target = "_blank">unnamed 1933 tropical storm</a> that developed on 26 October. It held this distinction
            until 2020, when <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Teddy target = "_blank">Hurricane Teddy</a> attained tropical storm strength on 14 September.
